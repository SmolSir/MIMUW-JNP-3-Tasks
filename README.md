# Sokoban!
Main project for the MIMUW-JNP-3 Haskell course (winter 2022/23) about recreating the [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) game in Haskell, starting from scratch.

## Play the game

### Full version
Visit the [Codeworld](https://code.world/haskell#) webpage, copy & paste the `codeworld/Sokoban.hs` file from `main` branch into the editor and press `Run`.

### Console version
With the [Haskell compiler](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) installed, just run the `console/Sokoban.hs` file from `main` branch.

## Contribute new mazes
Feel free to fork this repository and add the new level(s) either as a separate file, or as modification of appropriate, existing files.

## Bug reports
If you happened to find any bugs in either of the game versions, please create an Issue for it with a description of the problem you run into.
